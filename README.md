# HACKBIO - BIOCODING - INTERNSHIP
THIS REPOSITORY WAS CREATED TO STORE TASKS FROM THE HACKBIO INTERNSHIP PROGRAM ON CODING FOR LIFE SCIENCE
# HackBio Biocoding Internship - Stage Zero Task
### Task Description
This script organizes and displays details of a team of five members participating in the HackBio Biocoding Internship. The information includes:
- Name
- Slack Username
- Email
- Hobby
- Country
- Discipline
- Preferred Programming Language
### Data Structure Used
A **List of Dictionaries** is used to store each memberâ€™s details in a structured format.
### OUTPUT
The print() function was used to display the information in a structured format with spaces between each member for readability.

# HackBio Biocoding Internship - Stage One Tasks
### task 1 DNA to Protein Translation
This task involves translating a DNA sequence into a protein sequence using a series of steps. Below is a concise breakdown of the process:
- **1 define the function of the task to be performed**   - **2 convert DNA to mRNA** by replacing the "T" to "U"
-**3 define the codon table**   -**4 initialize the protin sequence** by create a store for the the amino acid sequence that will mak up the protein (a list was used)
-**5 instruct the computer to read the mRNA sequence in "3's" as codons**   -**6 stop translation at "STOP" codons**
-**7 add amino acids to protein sequence**     -**8 return the final protein sequence**     -**9 print DNA sequnce output and protein sequence output**

### task 4 Hamming distance between your slack username and X handle
This task involves writing a function to compute the Hamming Distance between two strings: a Slack username and a Twitter/X handle.
-**1 define the function of the task to be performed**    -**2 create a store for the distances that will be compared**
-**3 define what the maximum length is**   - **4 pad the shorted input to be the sam lngth as the maximum length using the "slack_username.ljust(maxlength)" "x_handle.ljust(maxlength)**
-**5 create a loop in a range(max_length) and compare the two inputs using conditional statements**   -**6 append(0) to the distance if they are similar and append(1) to the distance if they are not similar**
-**7 return th sum of the distance**   -**8 define the two inputs**    -**9 print the output**
